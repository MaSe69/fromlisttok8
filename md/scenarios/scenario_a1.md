# Scenario A1: Let's Go For The Big Party Room

## The scenario

You are member of a society.
Every year your society throws a party beginning of August. 
Some members suggest to go for a bigger loction next year.
The spotted location has to be booked at least 6 months in advance. It costs 800 € booking fee.

You get the task to do the 'administration stuff', especially because you have access to the bank account of the society.
The chairman has a list of members of the society.
In a smaller meeting, it is decided that everybody should be asked to pay at least 40 € in advance.
If 20 members make this payment, the big party room can be booked.

If the booking fee of 800 € is collected by 1st of February, then the booking should be made.
The information is rolled out to the team members on the black board, but also by spread of mouth.

## Your tasks 


On 1st of February, inform the chairman, if 800 € were transferred for the account of the society.

## Your list

From the chairman, you get the list of members.

## Adding data

You decide to add an additional column for payment. 
In that column, you add the payment done by the respective member, e.g. during a monthly check of the bank account.


## Analyze the data

On 1st of February, you sum up the values - and you inform the chairman. That's it. Done.

## Solution methods.

There a plenty of tools and solutions. A paper and pencil solution might be utterly sufficient here.
However, with more complex scenarios ahead, we discuss here the following solutions.

- [Scenario A1 - spread sheet](../a1_list)
- [Scenario A1 - program](../a1_program)

For this (simple) scenario, there is little justification to spend time, effort and money on a web application or beyond.
