# Scenario A2: Let's Go For The Big Party Room - Reminder

## The scenario

As described in scenario A1, you sent out an email asking for contributions to the booking fee for a big party room. 
In fact, you could add some bookings to your list.

Later that year, your chairman starts to get nervous. 
He asks you to write a reminder email to those members who have not paid so far.
The chairman provides you a list with all names and all emails.

## Your tasks 

Write an email to those members who have not paid yet.


## Your current list

When you look at your current list, you have plenty of names - and behind the names some payments, scattered all over the list.


## List operations

A well-known solution is to sort the table. 
After sorting, you have on one part of the table, e.g. the upper part, the list of members who paid and in the other part the list of members who did not. 


## Final work

Using the emails from the part of the list that contains 'no payments', you send the reminder email.


## Solution methods.

If you started with a paper and pencil solution, this might be the time to think about a computerized version.

Still no need for a web application here.
