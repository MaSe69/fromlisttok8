# Installation

## Install Python

Here, only Python is used. 

If you want to use another programming language, you need to do the transfer work from Python to that other language, which should not be too difficult.

I do not describe Python installation here, because it is better explained and kept accurate by the respective experts. 
Bearing in mind to transfer that Python program to GCP later, the installation here is directed to this goal.

After installation of Python, check that you can get a "Hello World" on the terminal.


## Python libraries

Libraries that are used in this context include
- matplotlib
- numpy
