# Data Input

Often lists start from scratch in a new Excel sheet. All entries are entered manually.
Obviously, this is only possible for a limited number of data.

In cases of existing or abundant data, you need a data input from other source. These data come in a format. There are currently two major formats
- csv
- json

Excel tends to make you saving your lists in *.xlsx format. This is fine, if you are sure that your lists never leave the world of Excel. Possibly, that is also what Excel wants you to do - to not leave. However, if you intend to leave, you need another format.
