# Programming

There are major changes between a spread sheet and programming on lists.

- History and versioning

When your data start to change over time, working on spreadsheets can get so cumbersome that time has come to move to the next level of sophistication: programming.


## Operations on list

A program transfroms a list from a status A to a status B. 

Such tranformations or operations are
- reduce the number of columns in your original list
- replace values
- append new columns from another list
- sort the rows
- analyze your list

On a spreadsheet, you carry out such operations in a 'what-you-see-is-what-you-get' mode. 
Example: You want to sort your list. Then, you select your list or part of it, press the 'sort'-button and you see that your list was sorted. The original list was modified.

Using a progam, you have an unsorted list. You run a program to sort your list. You get a (new) list that is sorted.



## History and Versioning

Based on the concept of operations, you can get a series of lists. Each list is one (or a few) operations apart from the other.
If you detect a mistake on a later list, you can always go back to the start and redo the sequence of operations, possibly having corrected a mistake before the re-run.


## Shift of workload

Having such tested operations available can drastically reduce the time that you spend on operating yourself on the lists.
In turn, you sepnd more time on designing the steps and the sequence of steps.
