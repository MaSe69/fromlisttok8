# Example With Registrations



In the basic example, the number of invitees was fixed. This made many things easier. 
Often it is advisable to reduce the problem such that the 'master data' are fixed - at least for a short period of time.

However, sometimes a fixed number of invitees is just not realistic.

## Examples

You start at zero. 
- A new business or offering
- A new initiative in your big company

You can address people and invite them, but you have no idea how many will show interest and participate.


## Solutions

As in the 'fixed invitees' solution, it is still possible to receive the input 
- by email
- by transactions on a bank account

Using the list solution, you need to manually transfer the data from an email to your list.

As the emails come in over time, you need to include a regular update. 

## Data cleansing

In this context, meaningful actions can be
- checking for dublicates
- checking for validity of email address


## De-Registration

If you allow anybody to register, you should also enable the de-registration. 
According to respective data privacy rules, it might even be mandatory to enable the de-registration.


## Snapshots Fixed points in time

As your list of invitees hence can be different at any point in time, you should take snapshots.
