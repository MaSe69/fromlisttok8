# Creating an account on Google Cloud Platform

Here, the choice is for Google Cloud Platform (GCP).



## Google Cloud Platform and its VM types


GCP offers 3 possibilities relevant in this context:
- Google App Engine
- Google Cloud Engine (GCE)
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

As it was described 
"App Engine is a Platform-as-a-Service. It means that you simply deploy your code and the platform does everything else for you."

"Compute Engine is an Infrastructure-as-a-Service. You have to create and configure your own virtual machine instances."

Though it would be easier to continue with the Googl App Engine, e.g. because Python comes pre-installed. Here, GCE is used, mainly because the transition to GKE will be later easier. GKE uses the Google Compute Engine.
