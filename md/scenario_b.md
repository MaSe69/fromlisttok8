# Scenario B1: Baking Recipes 


## The scenario

You want to summarize your favorite recipes for cooking.
You want to find the recipe quickly
- before shopping to check your own stocks
- during shopping to remind you
- at baking to follow the instructions
You optionally want to share your recipe with others.


## The task 

- You got the info about all incredients, but scattered on different sources.
- You got instructions what to do with the ingredients, but often repetitive, incomplete or contradictive.


## Discussion the methods

### Excel 

You might want to have one part of the sheet for your ingredients, e.g. the upper part.
Another part is for the instructions. You can also add a picture of the final product to your list.

For the repetitive parts, e.g. how to mix the ingredients for a dough, you can 
- copy + paste from one sheet to the other
- make a master sheet for the instructions and refer to these instructions from the respective sheets.

Usually, you create an Excel sheet on a bigger screen. The obvious disadvantage is to go to this bigger screen evey time you need to check your stocks or to remind yourself during baking. 
With a mobile as the default device available during stock checking, shopping and baking, you want to get the list on your mobile.
Though this is possible, it comes with the disadvantage that lists are not really made for mobiles. You might end up scrolling a lot, which is difficult with dirty hands during baking.


### Local Program

Create structures to hold the ingredients and structures to hold the instructions.


### Web Application

As your output is static, a static web site might be sufficient for your purpose.
On your mobile, your web page can suit your needs such that you just see exactly what you want to.


### Gobal Service

Certainly, you can go further and turn your static list of baking recipes into a global service.
In almost all cases, this might be overkill. 


## Conclusion + Discussion

For simple bakery existing solutions
- handwritten recipes
- books and journals
- professional web pages
might be sufficient for most people in most of the cases.

If you really want to have your own list, 2 out of the 4 solutions discussed here stand out:
- An Excel sheet, perhaps tuned to be good to read on your mobile.
- A web appliction.
