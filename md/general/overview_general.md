# General Overview

This web site is meant to popularize data science, including data management, data analysis and data governance.

Plenty of easy, but practical examples shall be given and detailed out.

## The data science life cycle

Data science uses typically the following steps:

- Define a problem such that it can be addressed with data
- Collect appropriate data
- Manage the data (data governance)
- Cleanse these data
- Wrangle the data
- Simulate data
- Put the data to a tool, which might be configured, adapted or written
- Analyse the data using the right methods
- Visualize the data
- Refine the cycle based on a first hypothesis
- Draw conclusion and present them

Depending on the context, steps can be omitted or need to be added. Such decisions turn data science from a craft to an art.

## Interfaces

Technically, data science has interfaces to 

- Statistics 
- Probability
- Programming
- IT

Non-technically, data science has interfaces to

- business models
- social topics
- project management
- psychology, e.g. problem solving


Key words:
data, model, relationship, regression, algorithms, analytics, prediction
probability, estimates, statistics, Bayes


## Out of Scope

Apart from the problems, this web site does not deal with

- Big Data
- Machine Learning

These are trendy, but special topics of data science, and best dealt with separately.
Plenty of stuff remains in 'normal data science'.
