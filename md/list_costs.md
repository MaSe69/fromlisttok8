# List and Costs

Though lists are really a great tool, you should always weigh, if the effort is really worth it.
In many situations, you can find a solution without any lists.

As a rule of thumb:
- Do not create a list for things that you have on your mind already or bring to your mind easily  AND that are short-lived.

By the time, you have created your list, others might have solved the problem already.
Further, during the time you create the list, you cannot enjoy other things in live.
As some may put it: "Have a life! Not a list!"

Having said that some joyful or important things in life just cannot happen without somebody creating one or several lists.
Let's think about a list as tool to get to some joyful thing in the future. 
However, we probably hope for many joyful things in the future, so not to put all eggs into one basket, the costs for a list - which for many is not the enjoyful thing itself, but only the clumbesome tool to get there - does not get to high. 
As they say in Project Management: "Time and money is always limited".


## Details and Costs

The cost of any list regardless of the tooling used increases with the details involved.
When creating lists, people often get carried away with too much detail.
Possibly, because the information is there already, and you do not want to throw it away. You think that you or somebody might need that information in the future.

Every list should have a clear purpose. For this purpose there is a minimum of information that is needed. Your list shall include no more and no less information than is required for that purpose.

You can learn elsehwere how to merge information again to your reduced list. Merging lists is a long solved problem. So, do not hesitate to reduce your list to the bare minimum of information.


## Solutions and Costs

Assumingly, you have a device to develop on and several devices for using your list afterwards, in partiuclar tablets, mobiles.
In an office environment, you typically have Microsoft Excel. If you privately do not have Excel, you can go for the free version.

Local program environments also come typically for free. Time and skills are the dominating factors here.

Costs occur once you start hosting anything on the Cloud. There are a few free offers, some of which will be discussed in this context.
In principle, however, you have to consider to pay for Cloud usage. Then, the principle question might be if the list is really worth that money.
In most cases, the answer is: no. In some cases, the answer is in fact: yes. 

Costs are the crucial question when turning from private (or local) to public. Once the request comes in to grow the list into a global service, costs are typically to be neglected. Time and feature pressure dominate in that phase.


## Benefits and Costs

Consider that writing was invented to prevent simple, but important information in the long-term memory of society. Particularly, the ownership of land was put on record.
Human short-term memory is very limited. Anybody can only keep a few things on his mind at the same time. Often, "seven" is reported as the magical number that can be memorized, then abstraction starts. 

Among the prominent advantages of lists are
- keeping the long term memory of important information
- dealing with complex information in a short time.

Weighing the expected cost of a list, keep in mind
- what is the loss of loosing this info?
- what is the benefit of keeping this info?
- what is the benefit of higher accuracy when dealing with the details (rather than doing some abstractions or approximations)?

When you conclude that the details are necessary (e.g. for legal reasons), always keep doing abstractions and approximations to anticate and double-check the results that you get as a result of the analysis of your list.
