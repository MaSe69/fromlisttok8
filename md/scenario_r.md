# Scenario R1: A registration list


## The scenario

Your familiy or team wants to organize an event. You get the task to do the 'administration stuff'. 
The event costs some money, e.g. entrance fee, rent of a ball room, a share of the buffet. 
At some point in time before the event, a decision meeting take place. 
At least 5 invitees need to have paid their fees.

Each member is invited, i.e. an invitee.
Each member needs to pay the fixed, constant fee in advance in order to partipate, i.e. paying the fee turns an invitee into a participant.


## The task 

- The number of invitees is fixed.
- You got the names of all invitees.
- You need to get the information about payment.
- You only need to check the information once, i.e. a


The registration might be realized as an email sent by the team member to you, and the team member states that he or she wants to participate.

Hence, the first task is to make a list with all registered persons.
As the event comes with some fee, every team member must pay an amout of money.

In a second step, you need to enhance the list with the information about the registree having paid his or her fee.


## Analysis

Obvious questions for analysis are
- How many team members have registered?
- How many have paid?
- How much money should have been received?
- How much payment is still open?


## Graphical Overview

For the next team meeting, you were asked to present how much money is still missing.
With a few computations more, you can show impressively that still a substantial percentage is missing.


## Conclusion + Discussion

For a simple task, you are completely fine with a digital list as shown here. 
Excel or LibreOffice have proven to be sufficient for such tasks.
