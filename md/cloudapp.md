# Cloud Application

For your application to be on the Cloud, you need a Cloud Provider. 

## Selecting Your Cloud Provider

The Cloud Providers that I am familiar with include
- [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)
- [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [Alicloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/)

Typically, a Cloud Provider has an 'always free' offering, which might be sufficient for the purposes here.
Further, there is mostl a 12 month free account offering, which should give you ample of time to try out your new Cloud application.

Beyond that however it has to be said that the Cloud Provider wants money from you. As you typically have to provide a credit card on opening your (free) account, there is no way to avoid these charges. Alternatively, if you do not want to pay, you need to accept that the Cloud Provider shuts down your service.
