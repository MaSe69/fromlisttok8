# Cloud Application

For your application to be on the Cloud, you need a Cloud Provider. 

## Selecting Your Cloud Provider

The Cloud Providers that I am familiar with include
- [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)
- [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [Alicloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/)

Typically, a Cloud Provider has an 'always free' offering, which might be sufficient for the purposes here.
Further, there is mostl a 12 month free account offering, which should give you ample of time to try out your new Cloud application.

Beyond that however it has to be said that the Cloud Provider wants money from you. As you typically have to provide a credit card on opening your (free) account, there is no way to avoid these charges. Alternatively, if you do not want to pay, you need to accept that the Cloud Provider shuts down your service. 


## Creating an account on Google Cloud Platform

Here, the choice is for Google Cloud Platform (GCP).





## Google Cloud Platform and its VM types


GCP offers 3 possibilities relevant in this context:
- Google App Engine
- Google Cloud Engine (GCE)
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

As it was described 
"App Engine is a Platform-as-a-Service. It means that you simply deploy your code and the platform does everything else for you."

"Compute Engine is an Infrastructure-as-a-Service. You have to create and configure your own virtual machine instances."

Though it would be easier to continue with the Googl App Engine, e.g. because Python comes pre-installed. Here, GCE is used, mainly because the transition to GKE will be later easier. GKE uses the Google Compute Engine.
