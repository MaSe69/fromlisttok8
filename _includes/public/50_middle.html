            Evolve Your Best Local Lists into Global Services
        </p>
        <p class="teasertext_first">
            Everyday, we create lists. <br>
            Most do not survive the day, but some turn out to be incredibly valuable. <br>
            These lists continue their life as lists and keep to be limited by the basic technology behind it. <br>
            Only few people seem to master the full path from a local list to a global web application. Let me try to
            change that here.<br>
            I start with a simple, but real life situation. I will expand it both in scope and tools used. <br>
            You will experience how increasing functionality and increased use of tools will fit together smoothly.

            Our journey starts with a list. Often, Microsoft Excel is used. A free-of-charge alternative is LibreOffice
            Calculator.
            The list has headers, columns and rows.
            You can vizualise the data using graphs.
            You can analyze the data using Pivot tables.
            You can share the lists on servers, e.g. Sharepoint.

            At some point in time, you realize that consistency of the data becomes very important.
            Repetitive tasks while maintaining the lists becomes cumbersome.
            It has become time to move on to a more dedicated way to store these data.
