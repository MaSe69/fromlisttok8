            Turn Your Best Local Lists into Global Services
        </p>
        <p class="teasertext_first">
            Everyday, we create lists. Most do not survive the day, but some turn out to be incredibly valuable.
            These lists continue their life as lists though they should proceed their way into global services.
            Mostly because we do not know how to perform the next step on this way. This site is meant to give you a
            step-by-step approach
            to proceed from a local list to a local program, and then from a local program to a public application.
            Finally, your list reaches the glory of a a global service with Cloud qualitities.

            Our journey starts with a list. Often, Microsoft Excel is used. A free-of-charge alternative is LibreOffice
            Calculator.
            The list has headers, columns and rows.
            You can vizualise the data using graphs.
            You can analyze the data using Pivot tables.
            You can share the lists on servers, e.g. Sharepoint.

            At some point in time, you realize that consistency of the data becomes very important.
            Repetitive tasks while maintaining the lists becomes cumbersome.
            It has become time to move on to a more dedicated way to store these data.
